# Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forest

**NAME**: MURARI YAMINI

**OBJECTIVE** : learn tree based models for classification and regression
we explore how Decision Trees and Random Forests can be used to predict whether a tumor is malignant(cancerous tumor) or benign(non cancerous) based on its physical characteristics.

This task also covers:

Tree pruning to reduce overfitting

Random forest ensemble learning

Feature importance analysis

Model evaluation using accuracy and cross-validation
